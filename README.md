# Melee-Stream-Tool
So you're interested in doing SSBMelee streams, huh? Luckily for you, with this tool you'll be able to update all the variables you need for the provided overlays with the provided GUI, and easily customize the overlays to make them your own!

This version of the Melee Stream Tool is modified specifically to fit wih data from Slippi via `slp-realtime` rather than the original stream tool where you would manually select characters, skins, ports, etc.

Notable changes:
 - Handle Sheik as her own character instead of a Zelda alt
 - No stream tool executable
 - Alt names, port references and more changed to match the output of `slp-realtime`

- A [VS Screen](https://gfycat.com/jitterymediumchimneyswift) is also included, to be used in pauses between games.
- Easy to customize! Made in html/javascript, every file can be edited at will!

## Customizing stuff

For the overlays/images, there are PSD files for both the game scoreboard and the VS screen to help you customize them.

For the video backgrounds, you can either replace them with other `.webm` files or just cover them with an image overlay.

And if you're brave enough to dive into the code, I tried my best to document everything inside the code so you have an easier time, so go grab those `html` and `js` files!

If you want to customize the GUI, thats going to be a bit complicated since you will have to learn how electron works yourself. In any case, the source code is also on this github!

And most importantly, this project was created using [RoA-Stream-Tool](https://github.com/Readek/RoA-Stream-Tool) as a base, so if you wanna go crazy on customizations, I really recomend you to check out that first, since it's way more documented (and also has a wiki!), especially if you wanna adapt this to other games. This Melee version is way more locked down.

Do you want to adapt this project to another game but can't figure out how to? Lucky for you, I'm open for commisions! Contact me on Twitter [@Readeku](https://twitter.com/Readeku) or on Discord `Readek#5869`!.

Do you want to support this project? [Buy me a ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/readek) or tip me [directly](https://streamlabs.com/readek/tip)!

This is one of my first projects in Javascript, if you know your stuff and look at the code, you may find ways to make the thing a bit more optimized (because right now... it isn't), and I would be happy to hear how to! Please, use this github to leave suggestions on how to imporve things.
